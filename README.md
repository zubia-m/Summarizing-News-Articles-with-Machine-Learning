# Summarizing-News-Articles-with-Machine-Learning

**Project Description**
The News Article Summarizer is a Python-based application that allows users to extract and summarize news articles directly from URLs. Utilizing machine learning techniques, the application parses the content of an article, generates a concise summary, and performs sentiment analysis to provide insights into the article's tone.

**Key Features**
_URL Parsing_: Extracts the main content of news articles from provided URLs using the Newspaper3k library.
_Article Summarization_: Generates a brief summary of the article using natural language processing techniques.
_Sentiment Analysis_: Analyzes the article's text to determine its overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) using TextBlob.
_User-Friendly_ _Interface_: Built with Tkinter, the application offers a simple graphical interface where users can enter URLs and view results.
_Detailed Information Display_: Outputs key details such as the article title, authors, publication date, summary, and sentiment analysis in a structured format.

**Technologies Used**
_Python_: Core programming language for building the application.
_Tkinter_: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
_Newspaper3k_: A powerful library for article scraping, parsing, and natural language processing.
_TextBlob_: For performing sentiment analysis and text processing.

**How It Works**
_Input URL_: Users enter the URL of a news article into the text field.
_Article Processing_: The application downloads and processes the article to extract key information.
_Display Results_: The title, authors, publication date, summary, and sentiment analysis are displayed in the interface.
__Sentiment_ _Insights__: Provides insights into the articleâ€™s sentiment, showing whether the tone is positive, negative, or neutral.
